# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![A screenshot of the final project](./design/screenshot.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). 

The challenge was fun when i went for it untile i faced this problem in the middle of the route..
The problem was that I had no idea how to set the rating values in the HTML, I thought about listing it as unorded list but how we can select the value we want and insert it in the Javascript? this was my biggest problem.
I ended up solving this problem after searching on the web with the ( input radio ).
The idea of hiding the input radio itself and controling it by its label was something new for me.

the other and final problem i had is:
what if the user didnt select anyvalue at all ?
so i had to add a validation way to the submit button .
I wanted to make so that if the rateValue is not equal to unidentified then run the code, but I couldnt even identify the "unidentified" - sounds confusing ? XD - so i ended up with just if rateValue is between 0 and 5 then run the code.

And thats it ! thank you for reading and thanks for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) on these awsome challenges :smile:
